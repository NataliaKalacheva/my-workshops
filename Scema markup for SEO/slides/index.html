      <h1>Basic Schema Markup / Structured data</h1>
      <p>by Kalacheva Natalia</p>
    </header>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Schema Markup, alse called Structured data</h2>
      <p>
        it is code that you place on your website to help search engines return
        more meaningful results to users. Schematic markup allows you to create
        rich descriptions that appear in search results.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Rich snippets, alse called Rich Results</h2>
      <p>
        Rich Snippets are normal Google search results with additional data
        displayed. This extra data is usually pulled from Structured Data found
        in a page's HTML. Common Rich Snippet types include reviews, recipes and
        events.

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <img width="49%" src="pictures/example1.png" alt="Rich results 1" />
      <img width="49%" src="pictures/example2.png" alt="Rich results 2" />

      <h2>How to implement? / Microdata</h2>
      <p>
        With microdata, you can specify structured data information in the HTML
        itself using the attributes of HTML tags.
        <br />
        + easy to add manually
        <br />
        - it is difficult to scale and automate when needed for larger websites
        (eg e-commerce).

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>How to implement? / RDFa</h2>
      <p>
        RDFa is similar to Microdata, which means itâ€™s also added through HTML
        tag attributes. The difference is that RDFa is older and more complex.
        It has other uses outside of the HTML realm and this means integration
        with other apps/platforms/servers is easier if they use the technology.
      </p>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>How to implement? / JSON-LD</h2>
      <p>
        JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is a technique for
        encoding and representing information about structured data using JSON.
        This is recommended by the W3C and Google, which means it is
        standardized.
